			<impact>
				A remote attacker with the ability to sniff network traffic could decrypt an
				encrypted session.
			</impact>
			<background>
				Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) is an encryption mode of operation where the decryption of each block of encrypted text depends on all of the preceding blocks.  CBC requires an Initialization Vector, a block of bits which starts the encryption and ensures that the encrypted text is unique. The SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 protocols may encrypt data using Cipher Block Chaining
				ciphers that use chained initialization vectors.

				SSL/TLS CBC Initialization Vector Prediction

				CVE 2011-3389
				The Browser Exploit against SSL/TLS (BEAST) may allow an attacker to perform
				a man-in-the-middle attack to obtain plain-text HTTP headers by conducting a
				blockwise chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) against an HTTPS session.
				This attack is an extension of two previously
				disclosed attacks against SSL. The first of these attacks was detailed by
				Gregory Bard in May 2004 (The
				Vulnerability of SSL to Chosen Plaintext Attack). This research showed
				that cipher block chaining mode used by SSL is vulnerable to decryption in
				cases where the attacker can control part of the plaintext. This attack proved
				to be difficult to implement against HTTPS sessions due to the attackers'
				inability to control the contents. This attack method was extended to support
				TLS 1.0 and improved in April 2006 (A
				Challenging but Feasible Blockwise-Adaptive Chosen-Plaintext Attack on
				SSL).
				In September 2011, Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong presented a modern iteration
				of this attack that utilized Java or HTML5 WebSockets as an entry-point for
				attackers. Using this method, attackers could host a malicious website that,
				when visited by victims, uses Java or WebSockets to establish a connection to
				any secured 3rd party website of their choice. If the user has an active
				session to the targeted 3rd party site, any cookies he or she has saved will also
				be sent. Since the attacker is initiating this request, he can control the
				length of the requested resource, allowing him to position the cookie on a
				block boundary. The attacker also knows part of the cleartext. If this can be
				done in a man-in-the-middle scenario, the attacker will be able to intercept
				this encrypted request and decrypt it off-line to obtain the cookie. If the
				cookie contains an authentication token, this may result in account theft.
				TLS 1.1 and later have been improved to use an explicit initialization vector
				strategy, rendering them immune to this type of attack.
			</problem>
			<resolution>
				Most browser vendors have released updates which prevent this attack, but some affected browsers still remain at this time, so it is still advisable also to fix the problem on the server side. SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 should be disabled on the server as follows:
				Apache: Set the following directive in the Apache configuration file. (The -TLSv1 argument requires Apache 2.2.24 or higher or an update from your Linux vendor.)
				SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3 -TLSv1
				IIS: See [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/245030] KB245030 and [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/187498] KB187498.
				Note that disabling SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 entirely on the server may affect the usability of the web site, as some web browsers may not yet support TLS 1.1.
