CVE 2016-2183
Block ciphers with small block sizes are susceptible to a class of attacks known as birthday attacks.
These attacks take advantage of multiple blocks which return identical ciphertext, known as collisions. The probability of collisions occurring becomes significant after a large number of blocks have been encrypted using the same key.
The SWEET32 attack is a specific birthday attack which reveals the XOR (exclusive-OR) between a fixed secret and known plaintext, thus allowing the secret to be determined.
This attack can be launched in a browser session by javascript code which makes repeated requests containing an authentication token and predictable headers.
Successful exploitation requires about 785 GB of data to be captured, and the attacker must be able to inject javascript into a web session and to sniff data from the network.

	<resolution>Disable ciphers which have a 64-bit block size, such as Triple-DES as follows:
Apache/OpenSSL: Upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.0, which disables Triple-DES ciphers by default. Alternatively, upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.1u or 1.0.2i or higher, which classify Triple-DES ciphers as MEDIUM, and insert !MEDIUM in the SSLCipherSuite directive in the appropriate web server configuration file.
IIS: Disable DES and 3DES ciphers as described in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article
[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/245030] 245030.
Note: disabling Triple-DES ciphers may affect compatibility with older clients.
